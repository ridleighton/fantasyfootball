## ESPN API Details

- **Endpoint**: `seasontype=2`
- **Weeks**: 1-18
- **Games per week**: ~16 games

## Database Schema

The `games` table includes:
- `week_type` - Type of week (regular, wildcard, divisional, conference, superbowl)
- `sync_override` - When true, prevents automatic updates
- `last_synced_at` - Timestamp of last successful sync

## Setup Requirements

### Netlify Configuration
1. **Pro Plan or Higher**: Scheduled functions require Netlify Pro or higher
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is configured
3. **Deploy**: Push changes to trigger deployment

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test ESPN API
node test-espn-sync.js

# Run locally (scheduled functions won't trigger)
npm run dev
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Netlify
git add .
git commit -m "Add automatic sync with playoff support"
git push origin main
```

## Monitoring

### Check Sync Status
View Netlify function logs:
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Select your site
3. Navigate to Functions
4. View logs for `scheduled-game-sync` and `scheduled-weekly-sync`

### Manual Trigger
You can manually trigger syncs via the admin panel or API:
- Navigate to Admin → Sync Games
- Select week type and number
- Click "Sync Now"

## Troubleshooting

### Scheduled Functions Not Running
- Verify you're on Netlify Pro or higher plan
- Check function logs for errors
- Ensure `@netlify/functions` package is installed

### Games Not Updating
- Check if `sync_override` is set to true
- Verify ESPN API is accessible
- Check function timeout settings

### Playoff Games Not Appearing
- Manually sync playoff weeks using the admin API
- Verify `week_type` is set correctly
- Check ESPN API response for the playoff week

## Season Transition

The system automatically handles the transition from regular season to playoffs:

1. **Week 18 Completion**: When all Week 18 games are final
2. **Automatic Detection**: Weekly sync detects season end
3. **Playoff Addition**: Begins syncing wildcard round games
4. **Sequential Progress**: Advances through playoff rounds automatically

## Best Practices

1. **Pre-Season Setup**: Manually sync Week 1 games before season starts
2. **Playoff Preparation**: Sync wildcard round when playoff teams are determined
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check function logs during critical games
4. **Manual Override**: Use `sync_override` for exhibition games or corrections

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Adaptive sync frequency (more frequent during close games)
- Webhook notifications for game updates
- Manual override UI in admin panel
- Sync history and audit log
- Rate limiting and API error handling
